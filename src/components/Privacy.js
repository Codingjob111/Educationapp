What Are Third Party Embeds?<br></br>

“embeds” are hosted by a third-party and embedded in the Platform. These files send data to the

post page with a YouTube video embedded in it, YouTube receives data about your activity).<br></br>

The Platform does not control what data third parties collect or what they will do with it. So, third
party embeds on the Platform are not covered by this Privacy Policy. They are covered by the
privacy policy of the third-party service.<br></br>
Sharing Information With Third Party Embeds<br></br>
Some embeds may ask you for Information, such as your email address, through a form. We do our
best to keep bad actors off of the Platform. However, if you choose to submit your Information to a
third party this way, we don’t know what they may do with it. As explained above, their actions are
not covered by this Privacy Policy. So, please be careful when you see embedded forms on the
Platform asking for your email address or any other Information. Make sure you understand who you
are submitting your Information to and what they say they plan to do with it. We suggest that you do
not submit Information to any third-party through an embedded form.<br></br>
