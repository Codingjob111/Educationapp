      <h2 className='look'> The Job Ready course in Backend Development is designed to provide comprehensive training in various aspects of backend development, including data structures, software development, and live project experience. The course focuses on equipping students with the necessary skills to work as backend developers, and it also includes freelancing training to enable students to explore freelancing opportunities in the field.</h2> 

<p>Here's an overview of the topics covered in the course and would be start with Basic:</p>

1. Node.js: The course starts with an introduction to Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Students learn how to set up a development environment, work with modules, handle asynchronous programming, and use the Node Package Manager (NPM) to manage dependencies.
<br></br>
2. Express.js: Express.js is a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. In this course, students learn how to build web applications using Express.js. They explore concepts such as routing, middleware, handling requests and responses, and implementing authentication and authorization.
<br></br>
3. MySQL: MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system. Students learn how to design and create databases, define tables and relationships, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and write efficient SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
<br></br>
4. MongoDB: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides flexibility and scalability for backend development. Students learn the fundamentals of MongoDB, including data modeling, document CRUD operations, aggregation, and indexing. They also learn how to integrate MongoDB with Node.js and Express.js.
<br></br>
5. Data Structures: Understanding data structures is essential for efficient programming and problem-solving. The course covers various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Students learn how to implement and use these data structures effectively in backend development scenarios.
<br></br>
6. Software Development: The course focuses on software development principles and best practices. Students learn about code organization, version control with Git, debugging techniques, and testing methodologies. They also gain insights into the software development lifecycle and agile methodologies.
<br></br>
7. Live Project: The course includes a live project component where students work on real-world backend development projects. This hands-on experience helps them apply their knowledge and gain practical skills in a professional setting.
<br></br>
8. Freelancing Training: In addition to technical skills, the course offers freelancing training to enable students to explore opportunities in the freelance market. Students learn about freelancing platforms, how to market their skills, and how to effectively communicate with clients. They gain insights into pricing, contracts, and project management in a freelance environment.
<br></br>
Additionally, this course provides regular one-on-one doubt sessions to address individual questions and concerns. The course consists of four classes per week, resulting in a total of 90 classes over the span of 6 months. These sessions ensure that learners receive personalized attention and have the opportunity to clarify any doubts they may have.

By the end of the course, learners will have a strong foundation in Frontend  development with  React.js. They will be well-equipped to pursue career opportunities in the field of web development, armed with the practical experience gained through the live project and the guidance received during the doubt sessions.
<br></br>



Throughout the course, students receive guidance from experienced instructors and have access to resources, tutorials, and assignments to reinforce their learning. By the end of the course, students should be well-prepared to work as backend developers, capable of building robust web applications using Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and MongoDB. They should also have the necessary skills to pursue freelance opportunities in backend development.
